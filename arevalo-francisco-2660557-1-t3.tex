\section{Interaction Diagrams}
\subsection{User/Robot interaction}
User can use an Item to attack a robot. The damage inflicted will depend on a calculation considering AC, range, and item damage.
User can use Items to heal, or improve his AC.
Robots can attack Users. If the user's HP drops below 0, he is removed from the map.
If the robot is disabled, the user earns points depending on robot type.

\subsection{User/Item interaction}
Users can collect, share, and use items they find on the map. When an user picks up an item, it is stored in his inventory. Depending on the type of item, the user can heal himself, load a weapon with ammo, improve his Armor Class, or use the item to attack a robot. Items have a charge level that shows number of times the item can be used. Users can share items with their teams if they choose to do so, via the Item menu.
